# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-09

First release: a Claude Code mod and a Spec Kit extension that share one ledger per feature, `specs/<feature>/xref.json`.

### Claude Code mod (`mod/`)

- The active spec in the system prompt (stable, cache-friendly), the current task and the drift status on every prompt.
- Intent log: the person's own words, prompt by prompt.
- Edit booking against `tasks.md`; unplanned edits reported to the model beside the tool result; optional strict mode.
- `@spec` anchors as coverage; dangling anchors as drift.
- Intent check after each turn that wrote files (`$.model.fork`, a completion fed by the intent log when there is nothing to fork).
- Band above the prompt, pane (Goal, Vision, Now, Todo, Status, Drift), `/xref`, tools `focus`, `where`, `link`.

### Spec Kit extension (`extension/`)

- `speckit.xref.map`, `speckit.xref.check`, `speckit.xref.report`; optional `after_tasks` and `after_implement` hooks.
- `xref.py` (standard library): `map`, `link`, `check` (with `--base` and `--fail-on` for CI), `record-check`, `report`, `dump`.
- A folder a task names counts as planned only while the task is open.
